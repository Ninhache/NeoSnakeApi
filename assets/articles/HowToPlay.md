# How to play NeoSnake 🐍

Even though it may seem obvious, let's explain how to play our game:

**Basics:** Move your snake using the arrow keys.

**Objective:** Eat all the fruits and their predetermined future positions to win the game.

## Future positions .. wait what ?

We've mentioned it briefly without a full explanation:

In NeoSnake, fruits don't appear randomly. All fruits and their future positions are predefined by the map creator. Once you've eaten all the fruits and their designated future positions, you move to the next scene!

> Essentially, you need to know the map as if you were playing Geometry Dash! 😆

## Scenes... What Are Those Again?

A map is divided into several scenes. You must complete all the scenes to win the game.

For example, if a map has 3 scenes, you will need to eat all the fruits and their future positions in Scene 1, then proceed to do the same in Scene 2, and finally in Scene 3 to complete the map!

## The difficulty

The difficulty level is set by the map creator and ranges from 1 to 5.

The creator has the freedom to choose any difficulty level; even if a map is astronomically hard, it can still be published. (Yes, we haven't yet implemented a system to "finish" a map before publishing it.. maybe a day 🙄)
